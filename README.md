### Hey 👋 I’m Arielle, a product manager and multidisiplinary designer 👩🏻‍💻
I’m coming from a background in industrial design and 10+ years of experience as a hybrid designer and director focusing on advertising, art direction, digital design, and brand identity systems. I want to utilize my multidisciplinary design knowledge to bridge the gap between software engineering and communication design. Chicago-based, but you can often find me sampling other cities.

- 👀 I’m interested in the bridge between software and design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative endeavors
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a glass blowing apprentice!
